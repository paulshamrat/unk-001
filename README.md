RMSD (Root Mean Square Deviation) plot displays the deviation of the protein's atomic positions from a reference structure over the course of the simulation. It shows the RMSD values as a function of simulation time. This plot is crucial in assessing the stability and conformational changes of the protein throughout the simulation.

## RMSF

RMSF (Root Mean Square Fluctuation) plot provides insights into the local atomic fluctuations of the protein backbone or specific residues. Specifically, it focuses on the RMSF values of the protein's CÎ± atoms as a function of residue number. By analyzing this plot, researchers can identify flexible regions and areas that undergo significant fluctuations during the simulation.

## RG

RG (Radius of Gyration) plot offers information about the protein's compactness or size throughout the simulation. It presents the RG values as a function of simulation time. This plot allows researchers to gain insights into the overall structural stability and folding/unfolding behavior of the protein.

## STRUCTURAL SNAPSHOTS

The STRUCTURAL SNAPSHOTS includes visual representations of the protein's conformation at different time points during the simulation. These snapshots typically depict the protein structure, water molecules, and other relevant components. They are valuable for observing changes in secondary structure, interactions, and solvent exposure, providing a visual understanding of the protein's behavior throughout the simulation.

The CONFORMATIONAL SNAPSHOTS showcases an animated GIF or video representing the protein's motion and dynamics over the simulation time. The trajectory allows researchers to visualize the protein's structural changes, movements, and interactions with water molecules dynamically. It provides valuable insights into the protein's folding, unfolding, and overall behavior throughout the MD simulation.
